# ASE Foundations — Day 9 CI/CD Exercise (Python DRF + React)

## Project: Task Manager — Full-Stack Deployment

A simple Task Manager application with a **React frontend** and **Django REST Framework backend**, containerized with Docker and ready for CI/CD deployment to Railway.

---

## Part 1: Local Setup & Verification

Before deploying anything, get the app running locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running
- **Git** installed
- **GitHub account**
- **Docker Hub account** (free: https://hub.docker.com/signup)
- **Railway account** (free: https://railway.app — sign up with GitHub, no card required)

### Run Locally with Docker Compose

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo>

# 2. Build and start both containers
docker-compose up --build

# 3. Open in browser
#    Frontend: http://localhost:3000
#    Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/

# 4. Stop containers
docker-compose down
```

## Part 2: Your Task

You need to take this working local application and deploy it to the internet using GitHub Actions and Railway. This involves 4 stages:

### Stage 1: Push to GitHub (10 marks)

1. Create a new **public** GitHub repository
2. Initialize git, commit the code, and push to `main`
3. Verify the code is visible on GitHub

### Stage 2: Containerize and Verify (20 marks)

1. Run `docker-compose up --build` locally and confirm:
   - Backend responds at `http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/`
   - Frontend loads at `http://localhost:3000`
   - You can create, read, update, and delete tasks through the UI
2. Build each image individually and verify:
   ```bash
   docker build -t taskmanager-backend ./backend
   docker build -t taskmanager-frontend --build-arg REACT_APP_API_URL=/api ./frontend
   ```

### Stage 3: Complete the CI/CD Pipeline (40 marks)

Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — it has TODO placeholders. Complete all of them:

1. **Test job**: Run `python manage.py test` in the backend directory
2. **Docker Hub login**: Use `docker/login-action@v3` with your secrets
3. **Build & push backend**: Build the backend Dockerfile and push to Docker Hub
4. **Build & push frontend**: Build the frontend Dockerfile (with `REACT_APP_API_URL` build arg) and push to Docker Hub
5. **Deploy**: Use the Railway CLI to redeploy both services from their latest Docker Hub images

You must also set up these **GitHub Repository Secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` — your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` — your Docker Hub access token
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN` — your Railway API token (Dashboard → Account Settings → Tokens → Create Token)

**How to get your Railway Token:**
1. Go to https://railway.app → click your profile (bottom left) → Account Settings
2. Click "Tokens" → "Create Token" → name it "github-actions"
3. Copy the token and add it as a GitHub secret

### Stage 4: Deploy to Railway (30 marks)

1. Create a **Railway account** at https://railway.app (sign up with GitHub — no card required)
2. Create a **New Project** → **Empty Project**
3. Inside the project, create **two services**:
   - **Backend service**: Click "+ New" → "Docker Image" → enter `<dockerhub-username>/taskmanager-backend:latest`. Under Settings → Networking → generate a public domain. Set the port variable to `8000`.
   - **Frontend service**: Click "+ New" → "Docker Image" → enter `<dockerhub-username>/taskmanager-frontend:latest`. Under Settings → Networking → generate a public domain. Set the port variable to `80`.
4. After both services are deployed and have public URLs:
   - You need to update the frontend so it knows where the backend API is. Two approaches:
     - **Option A (recommended):** Update `nginx.conf` to proxy `/api/` to your Railway backend URL instead of `http://backend:8000`, rebuild and push the frontend image.
     - **Option B:** Rebuild the frontend with the build arg: `docker build --build-arg REACT_APP_API_URL=https://<your-backend>.up.railway.app/api -t <username>/taskmanager-frontend:latest ./frontend`
5. Push a commit to `main` and verify the full pipeline:
   - GitHub Actions: ✅ tests pass → ✅ images built and pushed → ✅ Railway redeploy triggered
   - The live app is accessible via your Railway frontend URL and full CRUD works

## Part 3: Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Marks |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 1 | GitHub repository with all code committed and pushed | 10 |
| 2 | Docker Compose runs locally — both containers working, full CRUD functional | 20 |
| 3 | Completed `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — all TODOs filled, pipeline passes on GitHub Actions | 40 |
| 4 | Live app deployed on Railway — accessible via URL, CRUD works end-to-end | 30 |
| | **Total** | **100** |

### Submission

Submit the following:
1. Link to your **GitHub repository**
2. Link to your **live app on Railway** (frontend URL)
3. Screenshot of a **successful GitHub Actions pipeline run** (green checkmarks)

## Part 4: Concepts You Should Understand

After completing this exercise, you should be able to answer:

1. What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?
2. Why do we use a multi-stage Dockerfile for the frontend?
3. What does `docker-compose up` do vs `docker build` + `docker run`?
4. What are the three stages of a CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy)?
5. Why do we store secrets in GitHub Secrets instead of hardcoding them?
6. What happens when Railway pulls a new Docker image — what does it do with the old container?
7. Why does the frontend nginx need to proxy `/api/` requests to the backend?
8. What happens if the test job fails — does the deploy still run? Why not?

## Rules

- **AI can be used for reading documentation only — NOT for writing pipeline code**
- Google, Docker docs, GitHub Actions docs, and Railway docs are allowed
- If you get stuck on a specific step, ask your senior mentor — not AI
- Each commit should have a clear, descriptive message
